"""Middleware — one row per middleware, rolled up.

The grain here is a *middleware*, not one of its invocations: the question the
page answers ("which middleware ran, how often, and what did they block") is
about a set of invocations, so the set is the row. The per-invocation stream is
already served, at event grain, by ``/api/events?namespace=middleware``.

Three derivations happen here that the framework does not serve, and all three
are computed over the *whole* store rather than the filtered window, because
they are properties of the middleware rather than of the window. A window that
happened to exclude a guard's decision events would otherwise reclassify the
guard as a plain wrapper.

#: Middleware the framework injects itself, on every node and every model chain
#: respectively. They exist to emit the very events being read here, so they
#: appear in every session and carry no information about the code under
#: observation — a column that says the same thing on every row.
#:
#: An explicit list rather than an underscore-prefix rule, deliberately: guards
#: captured before the naming fix that landed on main report as
#: ``_middleware_fn``, so a prefix rule would silently swallow real user
#: guardrails along with these two.
_INTERNAL_MIDDLEWARE_NAMES = ("_observe_middleware", "_llm_observe")

#: Kind per ``middleware_type_id``, as a precedence ladder over the *specialised*
#: event types a middleware emits.
#:
#: Most-specific-wins is load-bearing, not defensive. ``@pre_llm`` and
#: ``@post_llm`` are both built on ``@wrap_llm``, so each emits its own
#: specialised pair *and* the generic ``middleware.model.invocation`` /
#: ``.response``. Measured on one agent run with every decorator stacked,
#: ``middleware.model.invocation`` fires four times — once each for the
#: ``@pre_llm``, the ``@post_llm``, the ``@wrap_llm`` and ``_llm_observe``.
#: Rewriting these ``LIKE``s as equality tests would label a ``@pre_llm`` a
#: plain model wrapper.
#:
#: The final band fallback catches an LLM-band middleware that emits no
#: specialised event at all, and on the current store that is the *common* case
#: rather than the edge. Counted over 109 sessions: nothing emits
#: ``middleware.model.input.*`` or ``middleware.model.output.*``, and the only
#: emitter of the generic ``middleware.model.*`` is the framework's own
#: ``_llm_observe``. Every user LLM middleware there — ``force_uppercase``,
#: ``counter``, ``print_message``, ``record_response`` — emits nothing but
#: ``middleware.invocation`` / ``.response`` under
#: ``spatial_parent_type = 'llm_and_middleware'``, so it lands on this rung
#: as ``llm_wrapper``.
#:
#: The consequence is worth stating plainly rather than discovering: a
#: ``@pre_llm`` is reported as a request transform **only when the framework
#: emits the specialised pair for it**, and where it does not, the honest answer
#: from the stream is "something wrapped the LLM call". The ladder is not guessing
#: past what was recorded, and the ``.input.%`` / ``.output.%`` rungs are kept
#: because they are right the moment those events appear — they carry
#: ``.invocation``, ``.response`` *and* ``.failure``, all matched by the wildcard.

def _middleware_rows_cte() -> str:
    """The middleware events every middleware endpoint is built from.

    Four things are resolved here so the listing, its count and its stats read
    one definition:

    * **Name**, from ``middleware.creation`` joined on ``middleware_type_id`` and
      **grouped by it**. The grouping is required, not tidiness: a type_id gets a
      creation event per process, so ``_observe_middleware`` alone has 225
      creations across 33 type_ids on a 3,887-event store, and an ungrouped join
      would fan each of its events out 7-fold. The join is global rather than
      session-scoped for the same reason it resolves at all —
      ``_llm_observe`` is a module-level singleton whose registration fires once
      per *process*, so sessions after the first carry invocations whose creation
      lives in another session's file. Measured: 0 of 1,545 events with a parent
      type_id fail to resolve globally.

      It stays a ``LEFT`` join with a fallback label anyway. An unresolvable
      middleware should appear as an unnamed row rather than vanish — a stream
      truncated mid-session is the case, and silently dropping its events would
      under-report every count on the page.

    * **Kind and band**, per :data:`_MIDDLEWARE_KIND_CASE`, over every event for
      the type_id regardless of the request's filters.

    * **The node**, which middleware events do not carry directly. Node-band
      events name it under ``spatial_parent_node_id``; LLM-band events name only
      the LLM invocation they wrapped, under ``spatial_parent_llm_invoke_id``, and
      the ``llm.*`` events for that invocation name the node — the same hop the
      event log makes. Grouped by the join key, like every join here. When the hop
      finds nothing, :data:`_NODE_SPAN_CTE` supplies the node that was running;
      see there for why that is a containment test and not a nearest-preceding one.

    * **The decision**, flattened out of the ``decision`` payload into ``action``
      and ``reason``. Only ``middleware.guard.*.response`` carries one; every
      other event contributes null, which is what keeps ``allows`` /
      ``transforms`` / ``blocks`` at zero for a non-guard rather than absent.

    * **Whether the middleware itself raised**, which is the part that took a
      correction. Every invocation ends in exactly one of ``middleware.response``
      or ``middleware.failure`` — that pair is the pass/stop signal, and reading
      only guard decisions meant a middleware that stopped a run by raising
      reported "passed". A `@wrap_node` that raises ``Exception("Negative numbers
      are not allowed.")`` is on this store, and it read as having passed the call
      it had just killed.

      A failure alone is not enough to blame it, though. An exception unwinds
      through *every* enclosing middleware, so one guard block emits a failure for
      the guard and one for each layer outside it — 5 deep on this store, and 34
      of 71 failures are that collateral. And a middleware wrapping a node that
      raised on its own reports a failure without having done anything: 45 of
      ``_observe_middleware``'s failures are the wrapped node's ``ValueError``
      passing through.

      ``raised_here`` separates them by asking whether what it wrapped failed
      first: if a ``node.failure`` or ``llm.failure`` in the same session carries
      the same exception message at or before this event, the exception came from
      inside and the middleware only sat in its path. Checked against the guard
      decisions, which are authoritative: all 14 blocks on the store are also
      ``raised_here`` or carry ``action = 'block'``, and no wrapper is.

#: both a block decision *and* its own failure, so counting the events reported one
#: block as two.
#:
#: **``interruptions`` is the other side of that split** and replaces a plain count
#: of failures. A failure means the call did not complete through this middleware,

    Feeds the Agent Traces column. Takes the session ids the caller already holds

    provably for exactly the rows being returned — a second copy of that
    predicate is the failure the shared-``WHERE`` discipline elsewhere in this
    module exists to prevent.

    Ordering is by each middleware's first ``middleware.invocation``, which *is*
    chain order: ``MiddlewareChain.run`` wraps in reversed order so index 0 is
    the outermost layer, and the outermost layer's invocation therefore fires
    first. ``MIN`` over all events rather than over the invocation alone, so a
    middleware that raised before emitting one still lands in position.

    Internal middleware is excluded unconditionally here. The column has no
    toggle — it is a fixed-width cell in a table of runs, where two glyphs that
    appear on every row would spend the width saying nothing.

    **The outcome is the worst thing this middleware did across the session, and
    the order of "worst" is deliberate:** blocked, then transformed, then
    interrupted, then passed. The first two are things the middleware *did*; the
    third is something that happened to it, so it ranks below them even though it
    is the more alarming word. A wrapper that an exception unwound through has not
    blocked anything, and colouring it as though it had would put a red pill on
    every layer of a failed run — which is the shape of the bug this replaces,
    where the shield beside these pills reported "all allowed" because the one
    decision that stopped the call had been dropped for lack of a node.
