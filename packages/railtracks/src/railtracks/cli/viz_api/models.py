    that nothing overrides and nothing emits. So the kind is derived in SQL from
    which *specialised* event types appear under a given
    ``parent_middleware_type_id`` — see :func:`queries._middleware_kind_case`.

    The derivation is a precedence ladder rather than a switch, and that is
    load-bearing: ``@pre_llm`` and ``@post_llm`` are both built on
    ``@wrap_llm``, so each emits its own specialised pair *and* the generic
    ``middleware.model.invocation`` / ``.response``. Measured on one agent run
    with every decorator stacked, ``middleware.model.invocation`` fires four
    times — once each for the ``@pre_llm``, the ``@post_llm``, the
    ``@wrap_llm`` and the framework's own ``_llm_observe``. Equality tests would
    call a ``@pre_llm`` a plain model wrapper; only most-specific-wins is
    right.

    ``NODE_WRAPPER`` and ``LLM_WRAPPER`` are the same decorator shape in the two
    bands (``@wrap_node`` vs ``@wrap_llm``) and are separated because the band is

    round trip.

    Every middleware invocation ends in exactly one of ``middleware.response`` or
    ``middleware.failure``, and that pair — not the guard decisions alone — is the
    pass/stop signal. Reading only decisions meant a middleware that stopped a run
    by raising reported ``PASSED``; a `@wrap_node` raising ``Exception("Negative
    numbers are not allowed.")`` did exactly that.

    ``BLOCKED`` therefore covers the two ways a middleware stops a call: a guard
    returning ``action = 'block'``, or any middleware raising an exception of its
    own.

    ``INTERRUPTED`` is the case a plain reading of ``middleware.failure`` gets
    wrong. An exception unwinds through every enclosing middleware — 5 layers deep
    on the measured store, where 34 of 71 failures are that collateral — and a
    middleware wrapping a node that raised on its own reports a failure without
    having done anything. Those invocations did not complete, but the middleware
    neither blocked nor transformed: it sat in the path. Calling that ``BLOCKED``
    would put a red marker on every layer of every failed run.

    The two are told apart by whether what the middleware wrapped failed first —
    see ``raised_here`` in :func:`queries._middleware_rows_cte`.

    ``TRANSFORMED`` still comes from a decision alone. A wrapper's effect on what
    it passed through is recorded nowhere in the stream, so claiming one would be
    inventing it.

    Roll-ups take the worst outcome in the order ``BLOCKED``, ``TRANSFORMED``,
    ``INTERRUPTED``, ``PASSED``: the first two are things the middleware did, the
    third is something that happened to it.
