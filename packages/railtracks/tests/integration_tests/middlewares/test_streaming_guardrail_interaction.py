"""Integration tests for rt.astream + guardrails/model_middleware interaction.

`OutputGuard._middleware_fn` awaits the *entire* raw model call (including the
streaming drain-to-queue path) before inspecting/transforming/blocking the
response -- meaning any chunks already pushed onto the astream queue cannot be
un-sent. These tests pin down what that means in practice: TRANSFORM can make
the streamed chunks diverge from `.result`, and BLOCK still propagates cleanly
even though chunks may have already been delivered. Zero tests combined
streaming with guardrails/model_middleware before this file.
